Note to Self
============

I think I made this app in May 2017 for a UI class. I hadn't intended to push this to git, so the git history is a bit messy (with gigantic commits). There was no remote origin specified, but I think I had performed a `git init` at some point in the past.

I used `git remote add origin git@github.com:HelloImKevo/JaxScienceFestival.git` and then `git push origin develop` and everything turned out great.
